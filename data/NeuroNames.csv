21,h,1,9,classical nervous system,Superstructure,brain,Br,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=21,"refers to one of two parts of the central nervous system (CNS) as defined by dissection in vertebrates. It is the part of the CNS located in the cranial cavity; the other part is the spinal cord. (Some biologists also use 'brain' in reference to the central ganglion of the nervous system of invertebrate species ( Wikipedia )). 
Neuroanatomists subdivide the brain in three different ways. Most textbooks and brain atlases are organized according to the Classical Model, which at the highest level divides the brain into forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Below that level structures are grouped by proximity as the brain is dissected to finer and finer levels. The Classical Model is reflected in the hierarchy of human and macaque brain structures that you find when you click 'Locus in Brain Hierarchy' below. It is reflected for the rhesus macaque brain in the Macaque Brain by Dubach, which you find by clicking 'Models Where It Appears' below. 
The definition of the brain in the second model, the Developmental CNS Model, differs from the Classical Model in that structures are grouped by the location of their precursors in the embryo; and it includes the retina, a structure which is located outside the cranial cavity of the mature animal but originates in the Encephalon (embryonic brain). (The retina is classically defined as part of the peripheral nervous system.) To avoid confusion, the standard NeuroNames terminology for structures defined by dissection of the mature brain are in English; standard names for subdivisions based on embryonic precursor are in Latin and capitalized. Thus, the highest level divisions of the Developmental CNS Model are the Telencephalon, Mesencephalon, and Rhombencephalon, which correspond to a large extent, but with significant exceptions, to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain of the Classical Model. (The Developmental CNS Model is not currently illustrated in BrainInfo.)
In the third model, the Functional CNS Model, structures are grouped by a combination of criteria, including embryonic origin, internal structure, connectivity, and function. Division at the highest level is into four structures: the pallium, cerebral nuclei, cerebellum, and cerebrospinal trunk. (The pallium consists of the cerebral cortex and the cortical subplate nuclei.) In the Functional Model the retina is a component of the cerebrospinal trunk. The concept 'brain' does not actually appear in the Functional CNS Model, because there is no functionally meaningful basis for distinguishing the part of the cerebrospinal trunk located in the cranium from that enclosed in the spinal column. 
The hierarchical organization of the Functional Model is derived almost entirely from appendices to the atlas of the rat brain in Swanson-2004 . To see it, click: <a href=""http://braininfo.org/OtherModels.aspx?requestID=2868&questID=&pTerm=Functional+CNS+Model+-+Rat"" target=""_new"">Functional CNS Model - Rat</a>. The NeuroNames terminology for structures in the Functional Model is, insofar as possible, the same as that for structures that are equivalent to structures in the Classical Model. 
Each of the three models is more useful than the others for certain purposes. The Classical Model is most useful for understanding the terminology of the neuroanatomical literature of the past century and for surgical and radiological applications, which involve dissection and/or visualization according to classical landmarks. The Developmental Model is more useful for analyzing the embryonic and genetic origins of brain structure. The Functional Model is most useful for addressing the fundamental challenge of neuroscience, namely to understand the relations between neural structure and function. 
In that context, the primary purpose of BrainInfo/NeuroNames is to clarify the relations between the structural concepts and the terminologies of these and other ways of looking at the central nervous system.",,

It extends from the interventricular foramen to the end of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The part nearest the interventricular foramen is between the lateral edge of the fornix and the upper surface of the thalamus; in the inferior horn it is between the fimbria and the stria terminalis ( Gray-1918a ). ,,

27,h,8,9,classical nervous system,Volumetric Superstructure,forebrain,FBr,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=27,"refers to one ot three components of the brain as defined in the Classical Model by dissection. The other components are the midbrain and the hindbrain.The most anterior of the three, its caudal boundary is with the midbrain: a nominally coronal plane defined by the rostral margin of the superior colliculus dorsally and the caudal margin of the mammillary body ventrally. The forebrain is composed of two parts: the endbrain and the interbrain.  Substructures of the forebrain are derived for the most part, but not entirely, from the embryonic Prosencephalon. It is found in the human, macaque, rat, and mouse ( NeuroNames ).",,
28,h,9,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,telodiencephalic fissure,tdf,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=28,"refers to the part of the transverse cerebral fissure that separates the ventral surfaces of the corpus callosum and fornix (of the endbrain) from the dorsal surface of the interbrain. Formed by the folding back of the endbrain over the interbrain during fetal development, it is technically outside the brain. It gets its name from the Telencephalon and Diencephalon, embryonic precursors of the endbrain and interbrain respectively. It together with the cerebrocerebellar fissure constitute the transverse cerebral fissure. It is found in the human ( Riley-1943 ) and the macaque ( Martin-2000 ), ",,
29,h,10,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,cistern of the lamina terminalis,cislt,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=29,refers to the cerebrospinal fluid filled space outside the brain and rostral to the lamina terminalis. The lamina forms the anterior wall of the third ventricle of the hypothalamus. The cistern is found in the human ( Riley-1943 ) and the macaque ( NeuroNames ).,,
30,h,11,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,chiasmatic cistern,ccis,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=30,"refers to the cerebrospinal fluid filled space outside the brain next  to the optic chiasm.

31,h,12,9,classical nervous system,Volumetric Superstructure,endbrain,EBr,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=31,"refers to one of two components of the forebrain. As the more rostral component, its most prominent cellular subdivisions are the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, the septum, and the basal forebrain. The more caudal component of the forebrain is the interbrain ( Carpenter-1983  ).  The endbrain is grossly equivalent to the cerebrum of the Functional CNS Model - Rat of brain structure ( Swanson-2004 ). It is found in the human, macaque, rat, and mouse.",,
32,h,13,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,olfactory nerve,1n,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=32,"refers to the first of the cranial nerves (I). It consists of very short filamentous bundles of unmyelinated nerve axons that originate from bipolar sensory cells in the olfactory mucosa high in the nasal cavity. They project through the cribiform plate, the thin boney roof of the nasal cavity, to the olfactory bulb on the floor of the cranial cavity. They are the first neurons in the olfactory system, which is responsible for the sense of smell. The nerve is demonstrated by fiber stains in the human, macaque, rat and mouse ( Price-1990 ).",,
33,h,14,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,terminal nerve,trn,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=33,"refers to one of two nerves forming the vomeronasal-terminalis nerve complex from the lining of the nasal cavity to the brain. It is found in the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and certain other animals ( Crosby-1962 ). Reports agree that the complex is demonstrable in the human fetus into the third trimester of gestation. They differ, however, as to whether it persists in the human beyond birth. Early authors said 'yes' ( Crosby-1962 ); later authors say 'no' ( Moran-1995 ). 
The other component of the complex is the vomeronasal nerve. The two are located in close proximity throughout much of their course, but arise from different parts of the nasal epithelium and connect to somewhat different areas in the brain. They are distinct from the olfactory nerve, which is found in both rodents and primates.  (See also: olfactory nerve, accessory olfactory bulb, and vomeronasal organ.) ",,
34,h,15,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,olfactory trigone,olt,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=34,"refers to a triangular area on the ventral surface of the forebrain of the human ( Carpenter-1983 ). It is a superficial feature, the floor of which is the olfactory tubercle (also known in the human as the anterior perforated substance). The peak of the triangle faces anteriorly and is formed by what early dissections suggested to be a split of the olfactory tract into medial and lateral olfactory tracts. Later studies showed that the fold of tissue presumed to be a medial olfactory tract did not, in fact, contain neuronal axons. The lateral structure is now recognized as the caudal continuation of the olfactory tract ( Price-1990 ).",,
35,h,16,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,longitudinal fissure,lf,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=35,"refers to the great fissure that separates the right from the left cerebral hemisphere. Defined by dissection, it is found in the human ( Carpenter-1983 ), the macaque ( Martin-2000 ), the rat and the mouse ( NeuroNames ). ",,
36,h,17,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,callosal sulcus,cas,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=36,"refers to the cleft that separates the corpus callosum from the cingulate gyrus; it opens into the longitudinal fissure on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere. Defined on the basis of dissection, it is found in the human ( Carpenter-1983 ) and the macaque ( Martin-2000 ). No comparable feature is shown in brain atlases of the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and mouse ( Franklin-2008 ).",,
37,h,18,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,anterior parolfactory sulcus,aps,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=37,refers to a vertical groove on the medial surface of the frontal lobe below the rostrum of the corpus callosum. It defines the anterior boundary of the subcallosal gyrus and is found only in the human ( Carpenter-1983 ).  ,,
38,h,19,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,posterior parolfactory sulcus,ppos,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=38,"refers to a vertical groove on the medial surface of the frontal lobe below the rostrum of the corpus callosum. Demonstrated by dissection, it separates the subcallosal gyrus rostrally from the paraterminal gyrus (also known as the 'subcallosal gyrus'), caudally. It is found only in the human ( Carpenter-1983 ).  ",,
39,h,20,9,classical nervous system,Volumetric Superstructure,cerebral cortex,Cx,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=39,"refers to the most prominent part of the endbrain as defined by dissection and Nissl stain. It derives developmentally  from the cortical plate of the embryonic Encephalon. In the adult human its average volume (two hemispheres combined) is 550 cubic centimeters, and the total number of neurons is estimated at 23 billion. Its surface area in the adult is three times greater than at birth, and two thirds of the surface is hidden in the walls of the sulci ( Zilles-2012 ).
In the human ( Mai-2004 ) and the macaque ( Martin-2000 ) it is divided by sulci and fissures into six lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe, limbic lobe, and insula. In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and mouse ( Hof-2000 ) it is a smooth structure.  
In the Functional CNS Model - Rat it is one of three components of the cerebrum. The other two are the cortical subplate nuclei and the cerebral nuclei. This definition is the same as the classical definition, except that layer 6b is provisionally classified with the cortical plate nuclei, not with the cerebral cortex ( Swanson-2004 ). 
The cerebral cortex of primates is classically subdivided topographically into lobes and gyri, on the basis of sulcal landmarks. In functional models it is subdivided into regions and areas of neocortex and allocortex on the basis of  internal architecture ( Stephan-1975 ).  While primates and rodents share almost no topographic landmarks, most of the architectonic areas of the rodent brain have equivalents in the primate brain. A number of architectonically defined areas of the primate brain, however, have no equivalent in the rodent. Those include particularly areas in prefrontal cortex and at the junction of the parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe of the primate.",,
40,h,21,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,uncus,un,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=40,"refers to a superficial feature of the rostral part of the parahippocampal gyrus where it ""hooks around the hippocampal fissure to form a medially protruding convolution"" on the anteromedial surface of the temporal lobe ( Carpenter-1983 ). In the human, the underlying structures include the anterodorsal part of the entorhinal area rostrally and the portion of the hippocampus that bends back on itself caudally ( Mai-1997 ). In the macaque it is formed entirely by the hook portion of the hippocampus ( Paxinos-2009a ). Brain atlases of the rat and mouse show no equivalent feature.",,
41,h,22,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,rhinal sulcus,rhs,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=41,"refers, in the primate, to a groove on the ventromedial surface of the temporal lobe that separates the entorhinal area of the parahippocampal gyrus from more lateral structures. In the human it separates the entorhinal area of the parahippocampal gyrus from the fusiform gyrus ( Carpenter-1983 ). Some authors regard it to be an extension of the collateral sulcus in the human ( Mai-2004 ). In the macaque it separates the entorhinal area from the inferior temporal gyrus ( Martin-2000 ). 
One of only four 'grooves' in the cerebral cortex of the rat ( Swanson-2004 ), it runs longitudinally on the ventrolateral surface, almost the entire length of the cortex. Caudally it separates the entorhinal area ventrally from the ectorhinal area dorsally. More rostrally, the perirhinal area intervenes between those two areas, and the rhinal sulcus runs within it. At about the anterior-posterior level of the hypothalamus, the ectorhinal area disappears and the sulcus separates the entorhinal area and the perirhinal area ventrally from the agranular insula dorsally. Rostrally from there, it runs within the agranular insular area and most rostrally it separates the piriform area ventrally from the agranular insular area dorsally ( Swanson-2004 ).  A similar but less prominent, interrupted sulcus is found in the mouse ( Hof-2000 ).",,

In those species it separates the dentate gyrus from the parasubiculum and presubiculum of the parahippocampal gyrus and from the subiculum of the hippocampal formation. In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and mouse ( Hof-2000 ) it separates the dentate gyrus from the CA1 field of the hippocampal formation.,,
43,h,24,9,classical nervous system,Superficial Structure,cingulate sulcus,cgs,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=43,"refers to a deep longitudinal cleft separating the limbic lobe  from the frontal lobe and rostral portion of the parietal lobe in primates. Defined by dissection, it parallels the genu of the corpus callosum and the body of the corpus callosum. In the human it separates the cingulate gyrus from the superior frontal gyrus dorsal to the body and rostral to the genu. Caudally it separates the cingulate gyrus from the paracentral lobule, finally curving upward to define the boundary between the lobule and the precuneus ( Carpenter-1983 ). 
In the macaque also, it separates the cingulate gyrus from the superior frontal gyrus rostrally; continuing caudally it separates the cingulate from the medial surfaces of the precentral gyrus, the postcentral gyrus and the superior parietal lobule ( Martin-2000 ). 
Comparable structures are not found in the smooth cerebral cortex of the rat or mouse ( NeuroNames ).  ",,

It separates the lingual gyrus ventrally from the cuneus and precuneus dorsally. In some cases it splits posteriorly into a dorsally curving superior calcarine sulcus and a ventrally curving inferior calcarine sulcus ( Duvernoy-1992; Martin-2000 ). Comparable structures are not found in the smooth cerebral cortex of the rat or mouse ( NeuroNames ).

In some cases the extension reaches the hippocampal fissure ( Duvernoy-1992 ), in which case it defines the boundary between the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus of the limbic lobe. While the calcarine sulcus of the macaque ordinarily extends equally far into the limbic lobe, the rostral portion is not named ( Martin-2000; Paxinos-2009a ).

It is defined by dissection. In the human it separates the superior parietal lobule from part of the supramarginal gyrus of the inferior parietal lobule and from all of the angular gyrus of that lobule ( Duvernoy-1992 ). In the macaque it separates only the supramarginal gyrus of the inferior parietal lobule from the superior parietal lobule ( Martin-2000 ). 
In both species the sulcus extends deep into the folds of cerebral cortex, splitting at some levels to form one or two small convolutions that are not visible from outside the brain. In the human, small unnamed convolutions arise variably from the superior parietal lobule, the angular gyrus, or the middle occipital gyrus to form gyri in the lateral wall or floor of the sulcus ( Duvernoy-1992; Mai-1997 ). This complex intracortical pattern can extend from the origin of the sulcus at the boundary of the superior parietal lobule with the postcentral gyrus almost to the occipital pole ( Duvernoy-1992 ). 
In the macaque, the hidden portion of the sulcus has been called the 'simian fossa'. It contains a single buried convolution, the annectant gyrus, which arises from the supramarginal gyrus laterally and, medially, is continuous with the wall of the superior parietal lobule. Proceeding caudally, the sulcus ends in junction with the lunate sulcus of the macaque at the rostrodorsal border of the occipital lobe. There a part of the annectant gyrus may split off to form the floor of the lunate sulcus of the macaque, while the main part, surrounded on three sides by intraparietal sulcus, dives beneath the fused cortex of the occipital gyrus dorsolaterally and cuneus dorsally and medially. Further caudally, the sulcus may open onto the longitudinal fissure, exposing a bit of the annectant gyrus through the cuneus on the medial surface of the occipital lobe. The annectant gyrus and an equal segment of occipital gyrus fuse their ends around a horizontal oval of intraparietal sulcus and detach from the overlying cortex to form a flattened tube that continues a few millimeters caudally in occipital white matter ( Martin-2000; Dubach-2008 ). In the rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ), the portion of the annectant gyrus that joins the lunate sulcus of the macaque follows a similar course ( Paxinos-2009a; Dubach-2008 ).

111,h,93,9,classical nervous system,Volumetric Superstructure,insula,Ins,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=111,"refers to a small but highly important island of cerebral cortex located deep in the lateral fissure of primates. Its overall shape, as identified by dissection in the human, is that of a pyramid with an insular apex directed laterally and a triangular base adherent to the extreme capsule in a roughly vertical plane.
The boundaries of the insula are defined largely by the limiting sulcus. In the human it is separated from the superior temporal gyrus by the inferior limiting sulcus; separated from the rostral parietal lobe and inferior frontal gyrus by the superior limiting sulcus; and from part of the orbital gyri by  the anterior limiting sulcus.The portions of the lobes that cover it are, correspondingly, the temporal operculum, the parietal operculum and the frontal operculum. The remaining rostral boundary of the insula is less distinct. Its rostrolateral junction with the temporal lobe is with the piriform area in the limen insula, and its rostromedial junction with the frontal lobe is through the transverse insular gyrus to the orbital gyri. 
Topologically the insula of the human consists of two parts separated by the central insular sulcus: the larger anterior insula and the smaller posterior_insula composed of the long insular gyri ( Ture-1999 ). In adult humans the insula of the left hemisphere is larger than that of the right ( Bamiou-2003 ). 
In macaques the relation of the insula to surrounding lobes is the same as in the human. The human insula, however, is further subdivided into seven or eight gyri, while that of the macaque is smooth except for the orbitoinsular sulcus. This small sulcus is found near the boundary of the insula with the orbital gyri and is not seen in the human ( Mufson-1997 ). The insula does not exist as a topological structure in rodents ( NeuroNames ). The most complex insula is found in cetaceans, such as the dolphin ( Mesulam-1984 ).
The human insula's many sulcal landmarks have little relation to its internal structure. Architectonically it is segmented according to two different schemes: a three part scheme of granular insula, dysgranular insula and agranular insula ( Mesulam-1982; Zilles-2012 ) and an earlier four part scheme in which the dysgranular insula is divided into a more granular dysgranular insular cortex (Roberts) and a more agranular insular cortex (Roberts) ( Roberts-1963; Roberts-1970; Paxinos-2009a ).
The areas of cerebral cortex in the rodent that are architectonically equivalent to the primate insula are the agranular insular area, the dysgranular insula ( gustatory cortex of the rodent), and the granular insula ( visceral cortex of the rodent ).
The insula is involved in the integration of many sensorimotor, socioemotional, and cognitive functions including gustation, visceral sensations and olfaction ( Fig. 3 in Kurth-2010b ); somatosensation (touch, pressure, temperature, etc.), as well as pain ( Fig. 4 in Kurth-2010b ); and attention, language, speech, and two forms of memory ( Fig. 5 in Kurth-2010b ).",,

The root of the confusion appears to be that anatomists who worked with either species in the mid-1900s and who used the term 'middle temporal sulcus'  referred to the occipitotemporal sulcus as 'inferior temporal sulcus' ( Crosby-1962; Roberts-1970 ). Since the late 1900s anatomists working with both species have settled on ' occipitotemporal sulcus ' for the more ventral sulcus ( Ono-1990; Martin-2000 ). Human atlases have settled on inferior temporal sulcus for the sulcus marking the lower boundary of the middle temporal gyrus ( Ono-1990 ), but macaque atlases continue to refer to it as a two- or three-part middle temporal sulcus ( Martin-2000; Paxinos-2009a ).

In the macaque ( Paxinos-2000 ), the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ), the indusium griseum is identified by histology with stains for Nissl substance, and the longitudinal striae are not usually identified in macaque and rodent brain atlases. Thus, in those species the indusium griseum is the histological equivalent of  the human supracallosal gyrus. In the rat and mouse the indusium griseum is a cell group embedded in the cerebral cortex at its junction with the corpus callosum.

('Hippocampus' in Latin means 'seahorse' in English.) Part of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal formation is an infolding of archicortex of the ventral part of the limbic lobe into the lateral ventricle. It consists of three predominantly gray matter structures: the dentate gyrus, CA fields, and subiculum, and two predominantly white matter structures: the alveus and fimbria ( Carpenter-1983 ). 
In primates it is a relatively flat structure the rostral end of which abuts the amygdala and curves medially to form the uncus. In rodents, where it constitutes a much greater portion of the cerebral cortex it curves up caudally into a C-shaped structure. With increasing knowledge of the region the term has come to be used for a broader set of predominantly gray structures in adjacent cortex.

Other common names for the CA fields are Ammon's horn and, simply, hippocampus. 'Hippocampus' is ambiguous, because it is also very widely used as a synonym for hippocampal formation and for archicortex.
Architectonically, the CA fields are part of the archicortex  ( Stephan-1976 ). The original description of the CA fields by Lorente de No ( No-1934 ) included a CA4 field, which subsequent investigators have tended to identify more with the hilus of the dentate gyrus than with the other CA fields. The hilus differs from CA fields 1-3 in terms of internal structure, connectivity and location in the dentate gyrus.",,

Classically the anterior amygdalar area has been classified as part of the corticomedial nuclear group of the amygdala (Click 'Locus in Brain Hierarchy' below; Carpenter-1983 ). In the Functional CNS Model - Rat it is part of the extended striatum ( Swanson-2004 ).  ",,

Defined on the basis of multiple criteria, it is subdivided variously by different authors. Most,divide it into an anterior cortical amygdalar nucleus and a posterior cortical amygdalar nucleus. In the human and the macaque its cortical surface is referred to as the periamygdalar area  ( Carpenter-1983 ), and some authors refer the the cortical nucleus itself as periamygdalar cortex ( Amaral-1992; Olmos-2004 ).

In the human ( Mai-1997 ) and the macaque ( Amaral-1992 ) it consists of two parts, the anterior part of the medial amygdalar nucleus and the posterior part of the medial amygdalar nucleus. 
In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ) it is subdivided into five parts: the anterodorsal part of the medial amygdalar nucleus, the anteroventral part of the medial amygdalar nucleus, the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdalar nucleus, the posteroventral part of the medial amygdalar nucleus and the nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract.

251,h,233,9,classical nervous system,Gray Primary Structure,endopiriform claustrum,En,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=251,"refers to one of five parts of the classical basal ganglia. The others are the striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala and claustrum. It is  a collection of cells located between the claustrum on the one hand and the piriform area and amygdala on the other. It relates in structure and topology to the overlying piriform area as the claustrum relates to the cortical area, particularly the insular cortex, which overlies it. The endopiriform claustrum is found in the human ( Yilmazer-Hanke-2012 ), the macaque ( Price-1990 ), the rat ( Swanson-2004 ), and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ). 
In rodents and the macaque it has two subdivisions: the dorsal endopiriform claustrum and the ventral endopiriform claustrum. In rodents both are located between the piriform area ventrolaterally and the external capsule medially; the location of the dorsal endopiriform claustrum is clearly superior to the ventral endopiriform claustrum. The temporal lobe of the macaque, which corresponds to the ventrolateral area of the rodent, is a much expanded, medially rotated structure. Thus, in the macaque the location of the ventral part of the endopiriform claustrum is medial and superior to the dorsal part ( Paxinos-2009a ). In the human the endopiriform claustrum is not divided into dorsal and ventral parts ( Yilmazer-Hanke-2012 ). Some anatomists divide it into several components: including ventral, prepiriform, diffuse, temporal, limitans, preamygdalar, and ventral parts ( Mai-2004 ).
The endopiriform claustrum of rodents is known as the endopiriform nucleus, which emphasizes its relation to the overlying piriform area ( Swanson-2004 ). Classically in primates it was known by a variety of names that emphasized its location between the claustrum and the amygdala; 'claustral-amygdalar area' for example ( Crosby-1962 ). Functionally it belongs to the cortical subplate nuclei ( Swanson-2004 ).",,

It is bounded laterally by the internal capsule, medially by the anterior column of the fornix and the lateral septal nucleus, and dorsally by the head of the caudate nucleus and the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. It is found in the human, the macaque, the rat and the mouse. Classically it is categorized as one of the septal nuclei  ( Andy-1968 ). In recent decades, however, authors have, on the basis of other stains and connectivity studies, subdivided it and incorporated it into a broader concept: (bed) nuclei of stria terminalis. This includes cell groups classically identified with parts of the anterior hypothalamic region and the substantia innominata. In the Functional CNS Model - Rat the nuclei of stria terminalis are categorized as part of the ventral pallidum ( Swanson-2004 ).",,

Caudal to the anterior commissure it lies deep to the globus pallidus and dorsal to the amygdala. Rostral to the anterior commissure it lies deep to the striatum. The more rostral portion contains the basal nucleus  ( Anthoney-1994 ).
In the late twentieth century the region containing the substantia innominata was resegmented on the basis of neurochemistry and connectivity to constitute the striatopallidal system  ( Heimer-1995 ). In this scheme the caudal portion of substantia innominata is located largely in the ventral pallidum and the rostral portion in the ventral striatum.",,

It is located rostral to the narrow paraterminal gyrus, ventral to the anterior cingulate gyrus and caudal to the superior frontal gyrus and straight gyrus. The nomenclature for this cortical region of the human is unusually confused  ( Anthoney-1994 ). In accord with the principle of naming cortical volumetric structures defined by dissection as gyri, lobules etc. and those defined by internal structure as areas, regions etc.,  NeuroNames adheres to the definition of Broca as cited in Carpenter-1983.
It is found in the macaque ( Vogt-1987 ), but not the rat or mouse, which do not have sulcal landmarks. The rat has a genu of the corpus callosum, but the area below it is occupied by the indusium griseum, a component of archicortex, not of cingulate cortex ( Swanson-2004 ). The mouse has no cortical area ventral to the genu ( Hof-2000 ).",,

In the rat and mouse it is a much larger structure in comparison to rest of the brain; there it occupies almost a quarter of the length of the cranial cavity ( Swanson-2004 ). Though classically considered a separate structure from the cerebral cortex in primates ( Nomina-1983 ), it is classified on the basis of internal structure as a component of paleocortex in all species ( Stephan-1975 ). In all species it is connected rostrally with the olfactory nerve. Caudally in primates it connects with the olfactory peduncle; in rodents it connects through the olfactory tract directly to the olfactory tubercle and olfactory areas (rodent) of the cerebral cortex ( Swanson-2004 ). It is a layered structure that contains cell bodies of the second neurons in the olfactory system. It is a key structure in the system that mediates the sense of smell.",,
280,h,262,9,classical nervous system,Gray Primary Structure,anterior olfactory nucleus,AO,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=280,"refers to the most rostral group of nerve cells that receive input from the olfactory bulb. The cells are identified histologically by Nissl stain. In the human and the macaque they form small groups scattered within the olfactory tract from the olfactory bulb through the olfactory peduncle to a much larger group on the dorsal surface of the tract on the underside of the orbital gyri. It is composed of several subgroups, which are defined by topology. 
Since the overall structure of the nucleus differs by species, the subgroups vary considerably. The human has only bulbar, medial,  and lateral subdivisions ( Price-2004 ). The macaque has, in addition, external and dorsal subdivisions ( Price-2004 ). The rat has medial, lateral, dorsal, external and posteroventral parts ( Swanson-2004 ). And the mouse has the same as the rat except for a ventral part and no posteroventral part ( Hof-2000 ). The nucleus is part of the olfactory system, which mediates the sense of smell.",,

It is located on the ventral surface of the endbrain caudal to the anterior olfactory nucleus, medial to the olfactory tract,  rostral to the piriform area and ventral to the nucleus accumbens and substantia innominata. It contains some of the islands of Calleja.
In the human it is so little developed as to be barely distinguishable from the overlying nucleus accumbens. In the macaque it is somewhat more prominent and bounded medially by the tenia tecta ( Price-2004 ). In primates it does not protrude from surrounding areas and is penetrated by numerous small blood vessels. These give it the appearance on dissection that accounts for the name 'anterior perforated substance' in human neuroanatomy ( Crosby-1962 ).
The location in the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ) is the same as in the macaque. It protrudes on the rostroventral surface of the endbrain where it is more clearly stratified and much larger in proportion to the size of the brain than in primates. It is involved in the sense of smell.  ",,

Defined on the basis of dissection it lies on the ventral surface of the orbital gyri in the olfactory sulcus between the straight gyrus medially and the medial orbital gyrus laterally ( Anthoney-1994 ). It contains parts of the olfactory tract and the anterior olfactory nucleus. It is found in the human ( Carpenter-1983 ) and the macaque ( Martin-2000 ). It is not found in the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) or mouse ( Hof-2000 ) where the olfactory bulb connects through the olfactory tract directly to the anterior olfactory nucleus, tenia tecta and piriform area of the rostral cerebral cortex. It is part of the olfactory system, which mediates the sensation of smell.

It contains axons from the second neurons in the olfactory system, which are identified histologically by fiber and myelin stains. The tract originates on the lateral aspect of the olfactory bulb. In the human and the macaque it runs in the olfactory peduncle, in close relation to the anterior olfactory nucleus, onto the ventral posterior surface of the frontal lobe. There it passes lateral to the olfactory tubercle around the junction between the frontal and temporal lobes onto the anteromedial part of the temporal lobe, where it overlies the piriform area and the amygdala ( Price-2004 ). In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ) it runs directly from the lateral aspect of the olfactory bulb to overlie the anterior olfactory nucleus and the piriform area lateral to the olfactory tubercle and thence to the cortical amygdalar nucleus. It is part of the olfactory system, which mediates the sensation of smell. Most authors continue to refer to the structure as the 'lateral olfactory tract', though the medial olfactory tract and the intermediate olfactory tract to which it was originally contrasted are no longer deemed to exist ( Price-1990 ) ",,

It emerges from the amygdala caudally then, bounded medially by the lateral ventrical, it arches upward in a semicircular path following the ventricle and continues anteriorly in the junction of the caudate nucleus with the thalamus. As it reaches the major part of the nucleus of stria terminalis some fibers split into smaller bundles, which  project ventrally to the medial preoptic area, the anterior hypothalamic area, and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus  ( Carpenter-1983 ).  Other terminal areas include the nucleus accumbens, the olfactory tubercle and,  perhaps, the midline nuclear group of the thalamus. Most prominent in the human is the hypothalamic component.The stria terminalis also carries some fibers from the hypothalamus to the amygdala  ( Olmos-1990 ).",,

Separated from the smaller nucleus by fibers of the optic tract, it is composed of two parts:  the ventral layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (layers 1 and 2), and the dorsal layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (layers 3-5).
Many authors refer to it as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus  or  DLG. That poses no problem in the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Franklin-2008 ), because the lateral geniculate nucleus lies dorsal to the other component of the lateral geniculate complex, the pregeniculate nucleus.. Applied to the adult primate, however, it causes confusion, because in primates the lateral geniculate nucleus is located ventral to the pregeniculate nucleus.

It is separated from the larger nucleus by fibers of the optic tract. It is composed of two parts: the rostral part of the pregeniculate nucleus and the caudal part of the pregeniculate nucleus ( Olszewski-1952 ). 
In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Franklin-2008 ) it lies ventral to the lateral geniculate nucleus, is closer to it in size, and is separated from it by the cellular intergeniculate leaf. It is composed of two parts: the lateral zone of the pregeniculate nucleus and the medial zone of the pregeniculate nucleus ( Swanson-2004 ). Some authors divide the nucleus of the rat into three layers ( Paxinos-2009b ).
The dorsally located structure of the primate and ventrally located structure of the rodent are considered homologous, because the embryonic origin of both is ventral to that of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and both are continuous rostrally with the zona incerta and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus ( Jones-1985 ).
Functionally the pregeniculate nucleus belongs to the reticular formation (functional) of the subcortical motor system ( Swanson-2004 ).  ",,

In the human the neurons are scattered along the base of the intermediate region between the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus medially, the retrochiasmatic part of the supraoptic nucleus dorsolaterally, the optic tract laterally and the anterior median eminence caudally ( Mai-1997 ). In the macaque the area is located somewhat more rostrally, in the anterior hypothalamic region, dorsal to the optic chiasm, ventral to the anterior hypothalamic area and medial to the retrochiasmatic part of the supraoptic nucleus ( Paxinos-2009a ). In the rat it is located between the anterior hypothalamic nucleus dorsally, the supraoptic decussations ventrally, the optic tract laterally and the tuberal nucleus caudally ( Swanson-2004 ). In the mouse it is located ventral to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and dorsal to the optic tract ( Hof-2000 ). Some authors regard the retrochiasmatic area, which is relatively small in the human, to be a  'tuberal part' of the supraoptic nucleus rather than a distinct entity ( Mai-1997 ).

In some humans ( Saper-2004 ) and in the macaque ( Paxinos-2009a ) it is divided into two parts: the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus and the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus. 
In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Dong-2004 ) it is divided into four parts. In addition to the dorsomedial and ventrolateral parts, an anterior part of the ventromedial nucleus and a central part of the ventromedial nucleus are distinguished. Functionally it is part of the behavior control column of the subcortical motor system ( Swanson-2004 ).",,

It is a small paired spherical protruberance located on the ventral surface of the posterior hypothalamic region, caudal to the posterior median eminence. It's posterior surface defines the boundary of the interbrain with the midbrain. 
Many authors use the term to refer to cell groups within the mammillary body. All who use the term in that sense include the medial mammillary nucleus ( Saper-2004 ); some include the lateral mammillary nucleus ( Swanson-2004 ); others include the tuberomammillary nucleus, the supramammillary area, and the premammillary nuclei as well ( BAMS ).",,

Defined on the basis of Nissl stain it is the most prominent cell group in the mammillary body. It has at least two parts in each of the species: the medial part of the medial mammillary nucleus  and the lateral part of the medial mammillary nucleus. They are partially separated by fibers of the fornix. In the rat and the mouse the nucleus has a third component: the median part of the medial mammillary nucleus. 
Some authors do not distinguish medial and lateral parts of the nucleus in the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ). It is composed of two parts: the body of the medial mammillary nucleus and the median part of the medial mammillary nucleus.

In the rat it is also medial to the premammillary nuclei  ( Swanson-2004 ). Because it is very similar in appearance to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, some investigators question the value of considering it a separate entity (Saper personal communication).

510,h,501,9,classical nervous system,Gray Primary Structure,periaqueductal gray,CGMB,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=510,"refers to the densely cellular core-structure surrounding the dorsal and lateral aspects of the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain. Extending approximately from the posterior commissure rostrally to the locus ceruleus caudally, it is bounded dorsally  by the commissure of the inferior colliculus and commissure of the superior colliculi; it is bounded laterally by the tectospinal tract and the mesencephalic tract of the trigeminal nerve ( Carrive-2012 ). Identified classically by Nissl stain, it is found in the human ( Carpenter-1983 ), macaque ( Martin-2000 ), rat ( Paxinos-2009b ) and the mouse ( Franklin-2008 ). 
The periaqueductal gray is distinguished from the cellular structures ventral to the aqueduct by its homogeneity. Indistinct internal boundaries have been identified on the basis of the shapes and sizes of cells, but they have resulted  in several different segmentations within and across species. The simplest segmentation reported to show a similar pattern across species is based on multiple criteria including, in particular, segmentation on the basis of differential staining for NADPH-diaphorase (nitric oxide synthase) ( Carrive-2012 ). Areas stained with greater or lesser intensity for that enzyme are grouped alternately into four longitudinal columns. In cross-section each column is narrowest at the aqueductal surface and widens toward the outer surface. The surface abutting the aqueduct is lined by ependyma ( Paxinos-2012). The four columns are the dorsomedial periaqueductal gray, dorsolateral periaqueductal gray, lateral periaqueductal gray, and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. 
Other substructures include the intercalated periaqueductal gray, supraoculomotor cap, pleioglia periaqueductal gray, and the nucleus of Darkshevich; some authors consider the supraoculomotor nucleus a component ( Paxinos-2001; Paxinos-2009a; Paxinos-2009b; Paxinos-2012 ). Authors differ as to whether these other structures are to be regarded as parts of the longitudinal columns or as independent structures ( Carrive-2012; Paxinos-2012 ). 
Functionally the periaqueductal gray belongs to the behavior control column of the motor system ( Swanson-2004 ). See also: motor periaqueductal gray.",,

Some authors subdivide it similarly in the rat ( Paxinos-2009b ) and mouse ( Franklin-2008 ).
Functionally it is divided into three parts in the rat: medial medial, external medial, and ventral medial parts ( Swanson-2004 ). The comparable segmentation in the mouse includes only medial medial and external medial parts ( Dong-2004 ). Functionally the nucleus belongs to the viscerosensory nuclei ( Swanson-2004 ). ",,

It is located adjacent to the lateral surface of the superior cerebellar peduncle of the pons. In the human it is subdivided into four parts: central, dorsal, external, and superior ( Paxinos-2012 ). In the macaque it has central, dorsal, external, and ventral parts ( Paxinos-2009a ). 
In rodents it is more differentiated. In the rat seven parts are identified: central, dorsal, external, extreme, internal, superior, and ventral ( Swanson-2004 ); in the mouse it has five: central, dorsal, external, superior, and ventral ( Dong-2004 ). Some authors find an internal part in the mouse as well ( Franklin-2008 ). Functionally the nucleus belongs to the viscerosensory nuclei ( Swanson-2004 ). ",,

In the rat and mouse it is subdivided into a magnocellular part of the lateral reticular nucleus and parvicellular part of the lateral reticular nucleus ( not to be confused with the parvicellular reticular nucleus ). The lateral reticular nucleus as defined by Nissl stain is not subdivided in most textbooks and brain atlases of primates. The A1 cell group of noradrenergic neurons is found in its vicinity ( Dahlstrom-1964; Felten-1983 ). Functionally it belongs to the postcerebellar and precerebellar nuclei of the behavior control column ( Swanson-2004 ).
The nucleus is also defined on the basis of multiple stains as consisting of three parts in the human ( Paxinos-2012 ), the macaque ( Paxinos-2009a ), and the rat ( Paxinos-2009b ) and: the parvicellular part of the lateral reticular nucleus, the subtrigeminal part of the lateral reticular nucleus, and the lateral reticular nucleus proper. The nucleus proper and parvicellular part are found in the mouse ( Franklin-2008 ).

Seltzer and Pandya (1978), regarding it as the same in location and architecture as area TE of Bonin, and the same as the combined area 20 of Brodmann (guenon) and area 21 of Brodmann (guenon), subdivided it into five areas.

Several trends of change in architecture across the first four areas in the sequence (TE1 - TEm) give rise to their distinguishing features: a trend toward greater development of the supragranular layers, more prominent pyramidal cells in sublayer IIIc of the external pyramidal layer (III), a better development of the internal granular layer (IV) and the multiform layer (VI). The myeloarchitecture of the first four areas follows a comparable progression from poor myelination in TE1 to development of distinct bands of Baillarger.

Distinctive features  ( Brodmann-1905 ): compared to area 1 of Brodmann (guenon) and area 2 of Brodmann (guenon) the cortical thickness of area 3 is unusually thin, in fact, among the thinnest areas of the cerebral cortex; the cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) are smaller, plumper and more densely distributed in a tighter strip; cells of the internal granular layer (IV) are distributed more sparsely; the internal pyramidal layer (V) is relatively clear with scattered large to very large pyramid shaped ganglion cells separated by tangentially oriented fiber bundles; the multiform layer (VI) is composed of a dense population of homogeneously distributed cells such that sublayers are absent and the boundary with the subcortical white matter is distinct.

Brodmann's area 14 is unrelated to area 14 of Walker and area 14 (macaque), which are located in the orbital gyri. It is more equivalent to the dysgranular insula or the dysgranular insular cortex (Roberts) of later architectonic segmentations. ",,

The external granular layer (II) is relatively dense. The external pyramidal layer (III) has a central stripe of less cellular density that separates two sublayers, IIIa and IIIb. The internal granular layer (IV) is sufficiently wide and dense to separate clearly sublayer IIIb from layer V. The boundary between layers V and VI is defined by larger ganglion cells, more pyramidal in shape, in layer V giving way to smaller, more spindle-shaped cells that become denser and more homogeneous deeper in layer VI. Often the spindle cells are arrayed horizontally as in the claustrum (VICl), which Brodmann considered a likely extension of layer VI beyond the extreme capsule (VICe)  ( Brodmann-1905 ).

1350,a,419,6,ancillary concepts,Not Defined,primary somatosensory cortex,S1,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=1350,"refers to a part of cerebral cortex defined on the basis of multiple histologic criteria and identified with the mediation of sensations originating from the skin, muscles and joints of the body ( Kaas-2004 ). The area was mapped functionally by evoked potentials to light touch in several mammalian species ( Woolsey-1958 ). In the human and macaque it is located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe ( Carpenter-1983 ) and is commonly referred to as the anterior parietal cortex ( Kaas-2012 ). In the human, proceeding caudally from the central sulcus, it is identified with the cytoarchitecturally defined area 3a of Vogts, area 3b of Vogts, area 1 of Brodmann (human) and area 2 of Brodmann (human) ( Zilles-1990 ). In the macaque it is identified with the equivalent areas of Vogts, area 1 of Brodmann (guenon) and area 2 of Brodmann (guenon)  ( Powell-1959; Paxinos-2009a ). Defined cytoarchitecturally in the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ) it is a wide horizontal strip on the dorsolateral aspect of the rostral two thirds of the cerebral cortex; it is bounded ventrally by the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsomedially by the primary motor cortex. That area in rodents corresponds to area 3b in primates. Different authors subdivide the primary somatosensory area of rodents into six to nine subareas. All include the whisker sensory area, the nose sensory area, the mouth sensory area, the upper limb sensory area, the trunk sensory area and the lower limb sensory area,  ( Swanson-2004, Paxinos-2009b ). In the Functional CNS Model - Rat the primary somatosensory area is classified as one of two somatosensory areas. The other is the secondary somatosensory cortex ( Swanson-2004 ).
",,
1351,a,423,6,ancillary concepts,Not Defined,prefrontal cortex,NA,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=1351,"refers to the large rostral part of the frontal lobe in primates. Defined on the basis of internal structure, it is six-layered granular and dysgranular neocortex. It is composed of lateral prefrontal cortex, orbital prefrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. The lateral prefrontal cortex is commonly divided into dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; and the medial prefrontal cortex is divided into dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. All are found in the human and the macaque. 
       Historically, application of the term ‘prefrontal cortex’ has varied greatly. Before 2020 the most inclusive definition for the human, based on architectonic segmentations by several authors, included all of Brodmann's frontal region (areas 9-12 and 44-47) and the three most rostral areas of Brodmann's cingulate region (24, 25, and 32) ( Zilles-2012 ). The macaque equivalent was prefrontal cortex (Walker). According to those definitions the prefrontal cortex occupied all of the frontal lobe rostral to the premotor cortex. 
       From mid-2020, the NeuroNames ontology and standard nomenclature will be based upon the multimodal segmentation developed in the Human Connectome Project ( Glasser-2016 ). That segmentation includes the same regions with the exception of the anterior cingulate cortex ( Vogt-2012 ), the current equivalent of Brodmann's areas 24,25 and 32.
     Many authors have restricted application of the term 'prefrontal' to fewer areas. Brodmann himself applied it only to area 11 of Brodmann (human). Many have  included only his frontal region in the definition ( Anthoney-1994 ), or only Brodmann's parcellation of the orbital gyri ( Crosby-1962 ), or only areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex of the frontal lobe located rostral to the motor cortex  ( Petrides-2012 ). 
      Most prefrontal cortical areas are of granular cortex or dysgranular cortex, which are unique to the frontal areas rostral to the agranular motor cortex of primates ( Zilles-2012 ). In the rat, the cerebral cortex located most rostrally, that is, at the frontal pole, is motor cortex and lacks an internal granular layer, Layer IV ( Swanson-2004 ). The rat, and presumably the mouse, have areas near the frontal pole that are cytoarchitecturally equivalent to a very narrow band of agranular cortex at the posterior margin of the primate orbital gyri. Continuous with agranular insular cortex, that area is the agranular insula of the orbital prefrontal cortex. Like the granular lateral prefrontal cortex, most of orbital prefrontal cortex is granular and has no equivalent in the rat ( Preuss-1995; Wallis-2012 ).Thus, while a PubMed search for articles with keywords 'prefrontal cortex in rat' results in a list of more than 8,000 citations, brain atlases of the rat ( Swanson-2004, Paxinos-2009b ) and mouse ( Franklin-2008; Hof-2000 ) do not show an area by that name. Based on those observations and reviews by Preuss-1995 and Wallis-2012, the  NeuroNames ontology does not contain a rodent equivalent for primate prefrontal cortex.

In primates it involves the frontoparietal operculum and the anterior insula. fMRI studies in the human suggest that the primary areas are in the ventroanterior part of the right anterior insula with smaller areas located bilaterally in dorsal parts of anterior insula and the long insular gyri. Areas in which gustation is associated with other functions include all of the ventral part, and a small area near the dorsal boundary of, the anterior insula ( Fig. 3 in Kurth-2010b ).
All studies of the macaque agree to a location on the inner and horizontal surfaces of the frontoparietal operculum, the portions of the postcentral gyrus and the precentral gyrus that overlie the dorsal part of the insula, which are identified as area OFO of Roberts ( Mesulam-1984 ) or area Gu of Paxinos (macaque) ( Paxinos-2009a ). That area receives a direct projection from the gustatory relay nucleus in the thalamus, i.e., the parvicellular part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPMpc). Reports differ with regard to the internal structure of the frontal operculum area; some label it granular ( Mesulam-1984 ), others dysgranular ( Pritchard-2012 ). Additional projections have been traced to adjacent dorsal parts of granular insula and dysgranular insular cortex (Roberts). Some have interpreted these to represent secondary gustatory areas ( Sewards-2001 ).
In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and mouse ( Hof-2000 ), the gustatory cortex is identified with the dysgranular insula. ",,

1727,a,968004493,6,ancillary concepts,Not Defined,plane of section,NA,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=1727,"refers to a cross-sectional view of the brain. The meanings of the terms sagittal plane, coronal plane and horizontal plane vary depending on the position of the head regarded as standard by the author. In BrainInfo they are defined in accordance with Gray-1918a. The body is assumed to be in the standard anatomical position, i.e., standing erect and facing forward. Sagittal planes are planes of section parallel to the median plane, ""the vertical antero-posterior plane passing through the center of the trunk. This plane will pass approximately through the sagittal suture of the skull, and hence any plane parallel to is termed a sagittal plane. A vertical plane at right angles to the median plane passes, roughly speaking, through the central part of the coronal suture or through a line parallel to it; such a plane is known as a frontal plane or sometimes as a coronal plane. A plane at right angles to both the median and frontal planes is termed a transverse plane."" A common synonym for the transverse plane used in BrainInfo is ""horizontal plane"".

See: large lateral hypothalamic neurons. Some neuroanatomists regard 'lateral hypothalamic nucleus' as a misnomer of an obsolete concept. The name is a misnomer, because the cells do not form a nucleus, i.e., are not a localized clustering of cells that share morphology, connections or neurotransmitter. The concept is obsolete, because the cells are now known to be distributed well beyond the bounds of the lateral hypothamic area ( Saper-2004; Saper personal communication ).",,

Whereas the classical nucleus of stria terminalis is categorized with the septal nuclei ( Andy-1968 ), the current, broader structural concept is assigned to different nuclear groups by different authors. For example, it is classified as part of the extended amygdala ( Heimer-1995 ) and, in the Functional CNS Model - Rat, it is classified as part of the extended pallidum ( Swanson-2004 ). Also, the structure is subdivided differently with partially overlapping terminologies in the human ( six parts in Mai-2004  ), the macaque ( ten parts in Paxinos-2009a ), the rat ( sixteen parts in Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( eight parts in Hof-2000 ).

The predominant input to area F5c is from area PT of the parietal lobe. It's involvement in motor acts is similar to that of area F5ab. It's visual function, however, is quite different. During observation of another animal performing an act, such as grasping an object, the same cells are activated as when the animal itself performs the act, the 'mirror neuron' phenomenon. Unlike cells in F5ab, cells in F5c do not respond during observation of the object alone. ",,

Its primary inputs are from area PEC and area PEip; it receives little or no input from prefrontal cortex (macaque). Most neurons are responsive to proprioceptive somatosensory stimuli.

In the human it comprises the dorsolateral part of area 6a beta of Vogts. In the macaque it is associated with area F7, which contains the supplementary eye field. It's primary input is from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Some neurons fire in response to visual stimuli unrelated to motor responses. Some respond to stimuli that match the target of an intentional arm movement. That finding, together with the observation that a lesion of the area eliminates performance of a learned arm response in the absence of other motor impairment suggests that it mediates working memory for spatial position in conditioned stimulus-response association tasks.

In the human it extends to the VCA line caudally in the superior frontal gyrus; in the macaque it occupies more of the precentral gyrus and less of the superior frontal gyrus than in the human. It is associated with area 6a alpha of Vogts. In the macaque it is also known as area F3. Its major input is from the adjacent dorsal part of the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the posterior mesial part of the superior parietal lobule (area PECg). It is more activated with the performance of simple motor tasks than in motor tasks requiring selection between actions. Electrical stimulation elicits multi-joint movements of the proximal, postural musculature more than of distal musculature. Unlike primary motor cortex, the parts of SMA proper mediating movements of different body parts overlap, but, as in primary motor cortex, there exists a rostrocaudal face-arm-leg gradient. It is proposed to control motor function globally by mediating postural adjustments appropriate to simple actions and in executing automatic motor sequences. In the human, the SMA proper is subdivided into to two areas: a rostral area SMAr and a more caudal area SMAc. The more anterior part of mesial premotor cortex itself is the pre-SMA.",,

In the human it  is associated with area 6a beta of Vogts, and its posterior boundary correlates with the VCA line; in the macaque it is known as area F6. 
Unlike other parts of motor cortex, whose primary inputs are from visual and somatosensory areas of the parietal lobe, the pre-SMA in the macaque has primary inputs from area 46 of Walker (caudal parts of the middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus) and banks of the anterior cingulate sulcus as well. It is regarded as a convergence zone for inputs from working memory, motivation and perception as triggers of complex actions. 
Stimulation of the area in the human can be associated with a conscious urge to move the arm or a sense that it is about to move. The area is activated as a person decides the direction of an action, such as a finger movement, in a task where any of several directions is appropriate. It is involved in learning sequential movement patterns. For example, the hand area is activated in a pianist playing an unfamiliar piece, whereas the SMA proper is activated as he plays much-practiced scales. The area is activated when a person holds in mind the appropriate response to a stimulus until the opportunity to respond arrives ( Geyer-2012 ).

The nerves are composed of neuronal fibers that conduct sensory information from, and motor control information to, the end organs  ( Carpenter-1983 ).

Latin terms are frequently used as synonyms of the English terms. However, some primary structures of the mature brain originally believed to originate from one subdivision of the Encephalon have subsequently been found  to originate from another. Thus, the classical organization of the mature brain and of the Encephalon differ in some respects. For that reason, in NeuroNames we shall eventually use the Latin term as the standard name for subdivisions of the embryonic nervous system that are precursors to a somewhat different combination of mature structures than the combination classically represented by the English term. Use of the term 'Encephalon' to represent the embryonic precursor of the mature brain and retina is a good example. ",,

The other component is the posterior part of the medial amygdalar nucleus. In the human ( Mai-1997 ) and the macaque ( Amaral-1992 ) the anterior part is located deep to the entorhinal sulcus on the medial aspect of the temporal lobe. It is bounded laterally by the anterior amygdalar area, ventrally by the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala and, in the human, medially by the cortical amygdalar nucleus. In the macaque it is located similarly relative to the anterior amygdalar area, but is bounded ventrally by the cortical amygdalar nucleus, or by the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract by authors who identify that structure in the primate ( Amaral-1992 ). In the rat ( Swanson-2004; Paxinos-2009b ) its rostral portion extends from the endorhinal groove medially; it is bounded dorsomedially by the lateral hypothalamic area, dorsolaterally, laterally and ventrally by the anterior amygdalar area and the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. More caudally  the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract intervenes between it and the sulcal surface and the optic tract intervenes between it and the lateral hypothalamic area; it is bounded dorsolaterally by the central amygdalar nucleus, laterally by the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala and ventrolaterally by the cortical amygdalar nucleus. Its topology in the mouse is similar to that in the rat except that it is partially bounded dorsally by the substantia innominata ( Hof-2000; Franklin-2008 ).

It is bounded dorsally by the substantia innominata, laterally by the central amygdalar nucleus, ventrolaterally by the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala and ventromedially by the posterior cortical amygdalar nucleus. Some authors report that, in the macaque, the anterior amygdalar area extends almost to the posterior extreme of the amygdala ( Paxinos-2009 ); by their interpretation this area, instead of substantia innominata, forms the dorsal boundary of the nucleus; according to this parcellation the nucleus itself extends further caudally, where its ventromedial border is formed by the amygdalohippocampal area. In the rat ( Swanson-2004 ) and the mouse ( Hof-2000 ) the posterior part of the medial nucleus has three components: the posterodorsal part of the medial amygdalar nucleus, the posteroventral part of the medial amygdalar nucleus and the nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract. Caudal to the anterior part of the medial amygdalar nucleus and ventrolateral to the optic tract it is bounded laterally and ventrally by the same structures as in the primate including, according to some authors, the amygdalohippocampal area at its caudal extreme ( Paxinos-2009b; Franklin-2008 ).

And it is bounded ventrally by the agranular insula, from which it differs by the presence of granule cells grouped in a single layer or as distinct clusters ( Mesulam-1982 ).

The dysgranular insula differs from the dysgranular insular cortex (Roberts) by its much greater width. A study based on thicker histological sections than examined in the Roberts-1963 study revealed clusters of granule cells in the agranular insular cortex (Roberts) and led to incorporation of that area into the dysgranular insula ( Mesulam-1982 ).

Classified as peripaleocortex, it is located between the piriform area ( paleocortex ) and the dysgranular insula ( proisocortex ).  
It is distinguished from surrounding areas by the absence of the external granular layer (II) and the internal granular layer (IV).

It contains a few granule cells, but they are scattered and do not form clusters or layers as in the other two histologically defined parts of the insula: the dysgranular insula and granular insula. 
It is the insular component of a three-part agranular area. The others, with which it is continuous, are the agranular orbitofrontal cortex and the medial part of the temporal pole ( Mesulam-1984 ).

Its equivalent in the macaque is a combination of area 10o orbitally and the portion of area 10m at the frontal pole where the superior frontal gyrus and straight gyrus merge. 
The rat has a tiny area at its frontal pole that is similar in that it is granular cortex with input from the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus ( Krettek-1977 ), but it is not regarded as equivalent to area 10p in the human ( Wallis-2012 ) or the architectonically equivalent area in the macaque ( Preuss-1995 ).

Its boundaries based on multiple fMRI,  functional and connectivity criteria are somewhat different in that the rostral boundary is with area a10p, the caudal boundary with area 13l, the lateral boundary with area 47m caudally and area a47r rostrally, and the medial boundary with  area OFC caudally and area 10pp rostrally ( Glasser-2016 ).

Identified on the basis of internal structure as peripaleocortex, it has a few scattered granule cells, but no clusters of granule cells that would define it as dysgranular or granular cortex.

The other component of insulo-orbital agranular cortex is the agranular sector of the insula. 
Defined on the basis of internal structure, it is identified by multiple stains. Caudally it is continuous with the agranular sector of the insula. It is bounded rostrally by area 13 and area 47. It is one of nine subdivisions of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex of Ongur in the human; the others besides those mentioned are area 10, area 11, area 24, area 25, area 32ac, and area 32pl. In the human it has four (perhaps five, see below) subdivisions: area Iam, area Iapm, area Iai, and area Ial ( Ongur-2003 ).  
The macaque has corresponding areas  ( Carmichael-1994 ): area Iam (macaque), area Iapm ( macaque), area Iai (macaque), and area Ial (macaque)...plus an area Iapl (macaque), which may have an equivalent in the human located beyond the portion of cortex evaluated by authors of the human study ( Ongur-2003 ). 
In the macaque, the agranular orbitofrontal cortex is one of six components of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (macaque). In that context it consists of two subdivisions: the medial agranular insular region and the lateral agranular insular region ( Carmichael-1994 ). It is considered to be the periallocortex of two paleocortical structures, the claustrum and the piriform area ( Mesulam-1982; Carmichael-1994; Zilles-2004 ).

In the human it occupies the entire orbital gyri, the transverse frontopolar gyri, the straight gyrus, the inferior rostral gyrus, the superior rostral gyrus, and part of the anterior cingulate gyrus. It is composed of the orbital prefrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex of Ongur, which are segmented into ten general areas: the agranular orbitofrontal cortex, area 10, area 11, area 47, area 13, area 14, area 24, area 25, area 32ac and area 32pl. Those are further divided into more than 20 primary areas, each of which was shown to differ from adjacent areas by at least two stains.
The orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (macaque) has architechturally equivalent areas that are similarly named except that the equivalent to area 47  is area 12. The only substantive difference is that the macaque lacks an area 32ac, and area 32 (macaque), which is topologically equivalent to area 32ac, is architectonically more similar to the human area 32pl ( Ongur-2003 ).  
In both species the orbital prefrontal cortex is largely granular cortex, which has no equivalent in the rat. Only the most caudal strip of the orbital prefrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex of Ongur  are agranular ( Preuss-1995; Wallis-2012 ).

Some authors include the anterior cingulate cortex, under the name medial prefrontal cortex of Ongur, as part of  frontal cortex ( Ongur-2003; Carmichael-1994 ).

In the human it is more prominent in the left hemisphere than the right, and it sends a projection to the inferior frontal gyrus, which includes Broca's area.

It is confusingly, but not uncommonly, equated with the anterior cingulate gyrus, which is defined by dissection ( Carpenter-1983 ) and which contains the midcingulate cortex as well ( Vogt-2012 ).  In all species, it is an area of agranular cortex defined on the basis of multiple criteria including internal structure, connectivity, and function ( Vogt-2013 )..
The other parts of cingulate cortex in the primate are the midcingulate cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the retrosplenial cortex. The composition is the same in the rodent, except that the rodent lacks posterior cingulate cortex ( Vogt-2013 ).
In the human the anterior cingulate cortex is located rostrally in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the subcallosal gyrus of the limbic lobe as well as adjacent parts of the frontal lobe: the superior frontopolar gyrus and the superior rostral gyrus. Its location in the macaque is similar, except that the macaque has no superior frontopolar gyrus or superior rostral gyrus. The rat and mouse have no sulcal landmarks  by which to judge its location.
In humans it is composed of eight areas organized in concentric arcs around the genu of corpus callosum. Listed in radial order from caudal to rostral and from ventral to dorsal, they are firstly, area 33o immediately adjacent to the corpus callosum; secondly, area 25, area s24ab, area p24ab,  and area 24c, and thirdly, area s32, area p32 and area d32. 
In the macaque it is similar except that it is rotated dorsally to a position more rostral to the genu; s24ab and p24ab are combined in a single area 24ab; and the macaque lacks areas 33o and d32.
In the rat it is rotated to an even more dorsal position relative to the genu; it is composed of the inner area 33o, a second arc of area 25 and area 24a, and a tertiary arc composed of area s32 (named v32 in the rodent} and p32 (named d32 in the rodent)  and area 24b ( Vogt-2013 )..  The mouse is the same as the rat, except that, like the macaque, it lacks an area 33o ( Vogt-2013 ).

On the medial surface of the frontal lobe it borders area 9m and area p32 caudally, area 9a dorsally. and its ventral border is with area 10r and area 10v.  Laterally it borders area p10p. On the orbital surface it borders area 10pp caudally. Defined by multiple criteria, it is fMRI-deactivated in GAMBLING contrast tasks. It greatly overlaps areas referred to by other authors as 10, Fp1 and Fp2 ( Glasser-2016 ). 
 In the macaque, area 10 is divided into area 10o on the orbital surface and area 10m on the medial and rostral, polar surface. Topologically, the human 10d corresponds to the rostral, polar part of macaque 10m ( Ongur-2003 ). As granular prefrontal cortex, It has no architectonic equivalent in the the rat ( Wallis-2012 ).",,

Located on the ventral margin of the gyrus, it is separated from the corpus callosum by the callosal sulcus. It is defined on the basis of internal structure. In the human it is bounded laterally by area p33' and dorsally by area 24b'. It is subdivided into two parts, area a24a' and area p24a'.
In the macaque, which lacks area p33', it is bounded by the corpus callosum in the depth of the callosal sulcus. It exists in the rat and the mouse as well but is not subdivided ( Vogt-2016 ).",,
4693,a,NA,6,ancillary concepts,Not Defined,area 24b',24b',http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=4693," refers to a part of the posterior midcingulate cortex, which is located caudal to the anterior midcingulate cortex in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the human and the macaque. Located in the center of the gyrus, it is bounded by area 24a' ventrally and by area p24c' and area 24d dorsally. Defined on the basis of internal structure it is subdivided into two parts, area a24b' and area p24b'.
In the macaque it is subdivided similarly. It exists in the rat and the mouse as well but is not subdivided ( Vogt-2016 ).",,
4694,a,NA,6,ancillary concepts,Not Defined,posterior parietal cortex,PPC,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=4694,"refers to a multimodal association region of cerebral cortex defined by dissection and and internal structure. It is  located on the lateral surface of the parietal lobe posterior to the postcentral sulcus. In the human, sulcal landmarks within the region are highly variable. It is composed of two parts, which are separated by the intraparietal sulcus. The more ventral part is the inferior parietal lobule. The more dorsal part, the superior parietal lobule, extends across the superior margin of the hemisphere onto the medial surface of the lobe. 
The equivalent architectonically defined structure in the macaque occupies approximately the same parts of the parietal lobe, except that, on the lateral surface it does not extend ventrally into the parietal operculum, and caudally, it it does not extend into the angular gyrus beyond the angular sulcus ( Amunts-2012 ). 
The equivalent in the rat and mouse may be the posterior parietal association areas ( Swanson-2004 ).

It is located in the subgenual area and adjacent part of the anterior cingulate gyrus of the human and the macaque, and in an equivalent region on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere of the rat and mouse. In the human it comprises area s24ab, and area s32.  In the macaque, rat and mouse it is composed entirely of area s32. The other subdivision is pregenual anterior cingulate cortex ( Vogt-2013 ).e ",,

4699,a,NA,6,ancillary concepts,Not Defined,area 24ab (alt),24ab (alt),http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=4699,"refers to the combination of area 24a and area 24b in a parcellation different from their combination as area a24 ( Vogt-2013 ). While the human, macaque, rat and mouse all have areas 24a and 24b, the designation 24ab in the alternative parcellation refers only to their combination in the human and the macaque, presumably because only in those species are both 24a and 24b located adjacent to the genu of the corpus callosum. In the human, area 24a is called 's24ab' for 'subgenual 24ab' and area 24b is called 'p24ab' for 'pregenual 24ab'.
In the macaque, the combination is called simply '24ab', a term that in NeuroNames is categorized as a synonym of area a24 as defined for the human in Glasser-2016.. ",,
4700,a,NA,6,ancillary concepts,Not Defined,area 24b of Carmichael,NA,http://braininfo.org/centraldirectory.aspx?ID=4700,"refers to a portion of the anterior cingulate gyrus that is defined on the basis of internal structure in the macaque. It is one of three components of area 24 of Carmichael in the medial prefrontal cortex (macaque). The other components are area 24a of Carmichael and area 24c of Carmichael. Features that distinguish area 24b of Carmichael from one or the other adjacent area are: 1) vertical striations revealed by Nissl stain in the external pyramidal layer (III) and internal pyramidal layer (V); and 2) few neurons stained for neurofilament protein by SMI-32 ( Carmichael-1994 ). 
This description is based on the definition of area 24b as a component of medial prefrontal cortex in the macaque. It differs somewhat from that of area 24b defined as a component of cingulate cortex ( Vogt-2012 ).
